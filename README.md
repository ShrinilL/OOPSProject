# OOPSProject
## Welcome to our project!
### This project implements a hotel management system where a customer can enter his/her details and check-in to a room. The customer can check-out and the menu has the options to check available rooms and also search the customer.
Concepts used-
  1. Encapsulation
  2. Inheritance (Hierarchical)
  3. Polymorphism
  4. Data Abstraction

We have created a menu driven program in which the user can choose from the options to check-in, checkout, availability, search customer, and exit.
We implemented arrays of objects and made each room as an object.
In our code, we have used friend functions as well.
